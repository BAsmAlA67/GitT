-A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 

A relational database is a connection between data, it uses a structure known as a "relational model" to organize data. This model is based on mathematical set theory, Key concepts in a relational database include: entity, attribute 
Entity: The things we store
Attribute: are what we store
1.	Record (Tuple & Row): A record is a single instance of data within a table. It's also referred to as a tuple.
2.	Column (Attribute): A column represents a specific piece of information within a table. It defines the type of data that can be stored in that column


-RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is a type of database management system that is based on the principles of the relational model. An RDBMS is designed to manage and organize data in a structured way, using tables with rows and columns, and enforcing relationships between tables.

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL provides a standardized way to interact with relational database management systems (RDBMS) to create, retrieve, update, and delete data. 
Key aspects of SQL include:
1.	Data Definition Language (DDL): DDL is used to define and manage the structure of the database. Common DDL commands include CREATE, ALTER and DROP 2.
2.	Data Manipulation Language (DML): DML is used to manipulate and query data within the database. Common DML commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 


Naming conventions in the context of databases and SQL refer to standardized rules and guidelines for naming database objects such as tables, columns, indexes, and other database elements.

Database design is the process of creating a structured plan for how data will be stored, organized, and accessed within a relational database.

Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a database. It ensures that the data is correct and maintains its quality throughout its lifecycle, from creation to storage and retrieval.
There are several aspects to data integrity: Entity Integrity, Domain Integrity, and Null Integrity.

Atomic values, refer to indivisible and irreducible elements of data. An atomic value cannot be further subdivided into smaller components with meaningful semantics within the context of the database system. 

Relationships refer to the associations or connections between tables in a relational database. These relationships define how data in different tables is related to each other.
 There are three primary types of relationships:
	One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:
•	In a one-to-one relationship, each record in one table is associated with exactly one record in another table, and vice versa.
One-to-Many (1: N) Relationship:
•	In a one-to-many relationship, each record in the primary table can be associated with multiple records in the related table.
Many-to-Many (M: N) Relationship:
•	In a many-to-many relationship, each record in the primary table can be associated with multiple records in the related table, and vice versa.
